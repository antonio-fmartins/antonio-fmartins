### Hello! I'm AntÃ³nio Martins...  ðŸ‘‹

Over the course of more than a decade, I have delved deep into the world of ocular optics and the optical lab, honing my understanding of the visual intricacies and technologies behind the lens. However, recently, I embarked on an exciting career transition journey to become a web developer. 

<h5>The Beginning of the Optics Journey:</h5>
Over 12 years ago, I entered the world of ocular optics with an overwhelming curiosity for how our eyes perceive the world. Working in an optical lab allowed me to explore the nuances of lenses, materials and ophthalmic prescriptions. With each pair of glasses I helped create, I gained a deeper understanding of the science behind corrected vision.

<h5>Mastering the Art of Optics:</h5>
Over the years, I became an expert at lens recommendations, analyzing complex prescriptions, and solving unique optical challenges. My ability to translate technical information into understandable language has led to customers trusting me to guide them in their lens choices. My passion for precision and the pursuit of the best visual experience shaped every customer interaction.

<h5>The Turn to Web Development:</h5>
As I continued to hone my optical skills, the world of technology called to me in unexpected ways. Fascinated by the intersection of creativity and code, I began exploring web development on my own. I quickly realized that many principles I applied in optics - such as attention to detail, problem solving, and a focus on user experience - were transferable to this new field.

<h5>Applying Optical Skills to Web Development:</h5>
My ability to visualize how different elements fit together became an asset when creating attractive layouts and interfaces. Understanding customer needs, cultivated by years in the optical lab, now helps me create customized digital solutions. In addition, my passion for precision has translated into writing clean and efficient code, ensuring that each "line of code" is as sharp as a well-polished lens.


<h5>Conclusion: Looking to the Future:</h5>
My 12+ year journey in the world of ocular optics has given me a unique perspective on the importance of vision and clarity. Now, as I navigate the exciting transition to web development, I feel excited to bring that same clarity to the digital experiences I create. While they may seem like separate fields, optics and web development share the pursuit of excellence and continuous improvement. Looking ahead, I am excited to see how my two passions continue to intertwine, creating a unique and exciting path in my professional journey.
