### Hello! I'm AntÃ³nio Martins...  ðŸ‘‹

Over the past 12 years, I have had the amazing opportunity to immerse myself in the world of optics and the optical laboratory, honing my skills and knowledge in this field. My journey began with a passion for the science behind vision and a desire to contribute to the improvement of people's quality of life through vision correction.
My career in ocular optics began with obtaining a diploma in Optical Technician and Ocular Optics Management. During my studies, I learned about ocular anatomy, diagnosis of vision problems and the science behind corrective lenses. After graduation, I had the opportunity to work in several opticians, where I could deepen my knowledge and develop my patient care skills.
However, it was in the optical laboratory that I found my true passion. Working in ophthalmic lens development and manufacturing allowed me to explore the technology behind the lenses, from the choice of materials to the cutting, grinding and coating processes. The precision and attention to detail required in this environment taught me the importance of meticulous work and the constant pursuit of perfection.
During all these years in ocular optics, I was challenged to solve complex vision problems, understand individual patient needs and provide personalized solutions. This experience honed my ability to communicate and empathize, skills I now find invaluable in any field.
Recently, I decided to make a career transition to become a web developer. This decision was not taken lightly; it was the result of a growing fascination with the digital world and technology. While working in optics, I began to realize how technology was transforming the industry, from vision testing apps to e-commerce solutions for eyewear.
I started my career transition journey by learning programming on my own and attending online courses. I found that many of the skills I developed in optics, such as problem solving and meticulous approach, were transferable to web development. The ability to understand user needs also proved crucial, as did the ability to create customized solutions to meet those needs.
My career transition is underway, and although I am leaving behind ocular optics and the optical lab, I will carry with me the valuable lessons and skills I have gained over the years. My experience in optics has enriched my understanding of science and technology, and I am excited about the possibilities the field of information technology and web development has to offer.
This journey not only demonstrates my adaptability and willingness to embrace new challenges, but also highlights how a passion for learning and growing continues to be a constant in my professional life.
